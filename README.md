# TTT4275-Project
A project in the course Estimation, Detection and Classification 

In this project the goal was to do estimations for the frequency and phase of a discrete complex sinusoidal signal afflicted with noise have been performed. The estimates are computed numerous times using FFT and the Maximum Likelihood Estimator for different values of Signal-to-Noise Ratio and FFT size. The errors between the estimate and the original value, as well as the variances of these errors, are calculated in order to compare the variances with the Cramer Raos Lower Bound to get a qualitative assessment of the performance of this estimator. Additionally, the frequency is estimated using another method which is based on fine tuning an estimate of a relatively short FFT size using a numerical search. This estimator is more feasible in practice, compared to using large FFT sizes for estimation.
